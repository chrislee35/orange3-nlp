of the said year the doleful effects of the pestilence began to be horribly apparent by symptoms that shewed as if miraculous Not such were they as in the East where an issue of blood from the nose was a manifest sign of inevitable death; but in men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or the armpits some of which grew as large as a common apple others as an egg some more some less which the common folk called gavoccioli From the two said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere now few and large now minute and numerous And as the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death such also were these spots on whomsoever they shewed themselves Which maladies seemed to set entirely at naught both the art of the physician and the virtues of physic; indeed whether it was that the disorder was of a nature to defy such treatment or that the physicians were at fault--besides the qualified there was now a multitude both of men and of women who practised without having received the slightest tincture of medical science--and being in ignorance of its source failed to apply the proper remedies; in either case not merely were those that recovered few but almost all within three days from the appearance of the said symptoms sooner or later died and in most cases without any fever or other attendant malady Moreover the virulence of the pest was the greater by reason that intercourse was apt to convey it from the sick to the whole just as fire devours things dry or greasy when they are brought close to it Nay the evil went yet further for not merely by speech or association with the sick was the malady communicated to the healthy with consequent peril of common death; but any that touched the cloth of the sick or aught else that had been touched or used by them seemed thereby to contract the disease So marvellous sounds that which I have now to relate that had not many and I among them observed it with their own eyes I had hardly dared to credit it much less to set it down in writing though I had had it from the lips of a credible witness I say then that such was the energy of the contagion of the said pestilence that it was not merely propagated from man to man but what is much more startling it was frequently observed that things which had belonged to one sick or dead of the disease if touched by some other living creature not of the human species were the occasion not merely of sickening but of an almost instantaneous death Whereof my own eyes (as I said a little before) had cognisance one day among others by the following experience The rags of a poor man who had died of the disease being strewn about the open street two hogs came thither and after as is their wont no little trifling with their snouts took the rags between their teeth and tossed them to and fro about their chaps; whereupon almost immediately they gave a few turns and fell down dead as if by poison upon the rags which in an evil hour they had disturbed In which circumstances not to speak of many others of a similar or even graver complexion divers apprehensions and imaginations were engendered in the minds of such as were left alive inclining almost all of them to the same harsh resolution to wit to shun and abhor all contact with the sick and all that belonged to them thinking thereby to make each his own health secure Among whom there were those who thought that to live temperately and avoid all excess would count for much as a preservative against seizures of this kind Wherefore they banded together and dissociating themselves from all others formed communities in houses where there were no sick and lived a separate and secluded life which they regulated with the utmost care avoiding every kind of luxury but eating and drinking very moderately of the most delicate viands and the finest wines holding converse with none but one another lest tidings of sickness or death should reach them and diverting their minds with music and such other delights as they could devise Others the bias of whose minds was in the opposite direction maintained that to drink freely frequent places of public resort and take their pleasure with song and revel sparing to satisfy no appetite and to laugh and mock at no event was the sovereign remedy for so great an evil: and that which they affirmed they also put in practice so far as they were able resorting day and night now to this tavern now to that drinking with an entire disregard of rule or measure and by preference making the houses of others as it were their inns if they but saw in them aught that was particularly to their taste or liking; which they were readily able to do because the owners seeing death imminent had become as reckless of their property as of their lives; so that most of the houses were open to all comers and no distinction was observed between the stranger who presented himself and the rightful lord Thus adhering ever to their inhuman determination to shun the sick as far as possible they ordered their life In this extremity of our city's suffering and tribulation the venerable authority of laws human and divine was abased and all but totally dissolved for lack of those who should have administered and enforced them most of whom like the rest of the citizens were either dead or sick or so hard bested for servants that they were unable to execute any office;

has lived rough and I'll raise Cain Your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn't hurt me I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin Jim He was growing more and more excited and this alarmed me for my father who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides I was reassured by the doctor's words now quoted to me and rather offended by the offer of a bribe I want none of your money said I but what you owe my father I'll get you one glass and no more When I brought it to him he seized it greedily and drank it out Aye aye said he that's some better sure enough And now matey did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth? A week at least said I Thunder! he cried A week! I can't do that; they'd have the black spot on me by then The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn't keep what they got and want to nail what is another's Is that seamanly behaviour now I want to know? But I'm a saving soul I never wasted good money of mine nor lost it neither; and I'll trick 'em again I'm not afraid on 'em I'll shake out another reef matey and daddle 'em again As he was thus speaking he had risen from bed with great difficulty holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out and moving his legs like so much dead weight His words spirited as they were in meaning contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge That doctor's done me he murmured My ears is singing Lay me back Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place where he lay for a while silent Jim he said at length you saw that seafaring man today? Black Dog? I asked Ah! Black Dog says he HE'S a bad un; but there's worse that put him on Now if I can't get away nohow and they tip me the black spot mind you it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can can't you? Well then you get on a horse and go to--well yes I will!--to that eternal doctor swab and tell him to pipe all hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow--all old Flint's crew man and boy all on 'em that's left I was first mate I was old Flint's first mate and I'm the on'y one as knows the place He gave it me at Savannah when he lay a-dying like as if I was to now you see But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg Jim--him above all But what is the black spot captain? I asked That's a summons mate I'll tell you if they get that But you keep your weather-eye open Jim and I'll share with you equals upon my honour He wandered a little longer his voice growing weaker; but soon after I had given him his medicine which he took like a child with the remark If ever a seaman wanted drugs it's me he fell at last into a heavy swoon-like sleep in which I left him What I should have done had all gone well I do not know Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me But as things fell out my poor father died quite suddenly that evening which put all other matters on one side Our natural distress the visits of the neighbours the arranging of the funeral and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain far less to be afraid of him He got downstairs next morning to be sure and had his meals as usual though he ate little and had more I am afraid than his usual supply of rum for he helped himself out of the bar scowling and blowing through his nose and no one dared to cross him On the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking in that house of mourning to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was we were all in the fear of death for him and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my father's death I have said the captain was weak and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength He clambered up and down stairs and went from the parlour to the bar and back again and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain He never particularly addressed me and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was more flighty and allowing for his bodily weakness more violent than ever He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table But with all that he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering Once for instance to our extreme wonder he piped up to a different air a king of country love-song that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea So things passed until the day after the funeral and about three o'clock of a bitter foggy frosty afternoon I was standing at the door for a moment full of sad thoughts about my father when I saw someone	day and needed quiet; besides I was reassured by the doctor's words now quoted to me and rather offended by the offer of a bribe I want none of your money said I but what you owe my father I'll get you one glass and no more When I brought it to him he	0.3857
the house Jim says he rum ; and as he spoke he reeled a little and caught himself with one hand against the wall Are you hurt? cried I Rum he repeated I must get away from here Rum! Rum! I ran to fetch it but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out and I broke one glass and fouled the tap and while I was still getting in my own way I heard a loud fall in the parlour and running in beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor At the same instant my mother alarmed by the cries and fighting came running downstairs to help me Between us we raised his head He was breathing very loud and hard but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour Dear deary me cried my mother what a disgrace upon the house! And your poor father sick! In the meantime we had no idea what to do to help the captain nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger I got the rum to be sure and tried to put it down his throat but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in on his visit to my father Oh doctor we cried what shall we do? Where is he wounded? Wounded? A fiddle-stick's end! said the doctor No more wounded than you or I The man has had a stroke as I warned him Now Mrs Hawkins just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him if possible nothing about it For my part I must do my best to save this fellow's trebly worthless life; Jim you get me a basin When I got back with the basin the doctor had already ripped up the captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm It was tattooed in several places Here's luck A fair wind and Billy Bones his fancy were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done as I thought with great spirit Prophetic said the doctor touching this picture with his finger And now Master Billy Bones if that be your name we'll have a look at the colour of your blood Jim he said are you afraid of blood? No sir said I Well then said he you hold the basin ; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me and he looked relieved But suddenly his colour changed and he tried to raise himself crying Where's Black Dog? There is no Black Dog here said the doctor except what you have on your own back You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke precisely as I told you; and I have just very much against my own will dragged you headforemost out of the grave Now Mr Bones-- That's not my name he interrupted Much I care returned the doctor It's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you but if you take one you'll take another and another and I stake my wig if you don't break off short you'll die--do you understand that?--die and go to your own place like the man in the Bible Come now make an effort I'll help you to your bed for once Between us with much trouble we managed to hoist him upstairs and laid him on his bed where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting Now mind you said the doctor I clear my conscience--the name of rum for you is death And with that he went off to see my father taking me with him by the arm This is nothing he said as soon as he had closed the door I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week where he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke would settle him 3 The Black Spot ABOUT noon I stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinks and medicines He was lying very much as we had left him only a little higher and he seemed both weak and excited Jim he said you're the only one here that's worth anything and you	sure and tried to put it down his throat but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in on his visit to my father Oh doctor we cried what shall we do?

same as the tattoo mark Billy Bones his fancy ; then there was Mr W Bones mate No more rum Off Palm Key he got itt and some other snatches mostly single words and unintelligible I could not help wondering who it was that had got itt and what itt was that he got A knife in his back as like as not Not much instruction there said Dr Livesey as he passed on The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money as in common account-books but instead of explanatory writing only a varying number of crosses between the two On the 12th of June 1745 for instance a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause In a few cases to be sure the name of a place would be added as Offe Caraccas or a mere entry of latitude and longitude as 62o 17' 20 19o 2' 40 The record lasted over nearly twenty years the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions and these words appended Bones his pile I can't make head or tail of this said Dr Livesey The thing is as clear as noonday cried the squire This is the black-hearted hound's account-book These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered The sums are the scoundrel's share and where he feared an ambiguity you see he added something clearer 'Offe Caraccas ' now; you see here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast God help the poor souls that manned her--coral long ago Right! said the doctor See what it is to be a traveller Right! And the amounts increase you see as he rose in rank There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French English and Spanish moneys to a common value Thrifty man! cried the doctor He wasn't the one to be cheated And now said the squire for the other The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal; the very thimble perhaps that I had found in the captain's pocket The doctor opened the seals with great care and there fell out the map of an island with latitude and longitude soundings names of hills and bays and inlets and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores It was about nine miles long and five across shaped you might say like a fat dragon standing up and had two fine land-locked harbours and a hill in the centre part marked The Spy-glass There were several additions of a later date but above all three crosses of red ink--two on the north part of the island one in the southwest--and beside this last in the same red ink and in a small neat hand very different from the captain's tottery characters these words: Bulk of treasure here Over on the back the same hand had written this further information: Tall tree Spy-glass shoulder bearing a point to the N of N N E Skeleton Island E S E and by E Ten feet The bar silver is in the north cache; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it The arms are easy found in the sand-hill N point of north inlet cape bearing E and a quarter N J F That was all; but brief as it was and to me incomprehensible it filled the squire and Dr Livesey with delight Livesey said the squire you will give up this wretched practice at once Tomorrow I start for Bristol In three weeks' time--three weeks!--two weeks--ten days--we'll have the best ship sir and the choicest crew in England Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy You'll make a famous cabin-boy Hawkins You Livesey are ship's doctor; I am admiral We'll take Redruth Joyce and Hunter We'll have favourable winds a quick passage and not the least difficulty in finding the spot and money to eat to roll in to play duck and drake with ever after Trelawney said the doctor I'll go with you; and I'll go bail for it so will Jim and be a credit to the undertaking There's only one man I'm afraid of And who's that? cried the squire Name the dog sir! You replied the doctor; for you cannot hold your tongue We are not the only men who know of this paper These fellows who attacked the inn tonight--bold desperate blades for sure--and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger and more I dare say not far off are one and all through thick and thin bound that they'll get that money We must none	after Trelawney said the doctor I'll go with you; and I'll go bail for it so will Jim and be a credit to the undertaking There's only one man I'm afraid of And who's that? cried the squire Name the dog sir!
